### Functional Interface

`@FunctionalInterface` was introduced with Java 8, which has only one abstract method. The compiler treats any interface meeting the definition of a functional interface as a functional interface, i.e, `@FunctionalInterface` annotation was optional

Examples:


```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Converter<F, T> {
    T to(F from);
}
```

```java
Converter<String, Integer> converter = (from) -> Integer::valueOf;
Integer converted = converter.to("999");
System.out.println(converted);    // 999
```

`Note:` Even without the `@FunctionalInterface`, it is valid as it meets the definition of **Functional Interface**
